PocketBase React SDK
======================================================================
Unofficial React SDK (React, React Native, Expo) for interacting with the [PocketBase JS SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk).

## Installation

### React Native or Expo


```sh
# Using npm
npm install pocketbase-reactjs  --save

#Using yarn
yarn add pocketbase-reactjs
```
```tsx
import { Pocketbase } from 'pocketbase-react';
```

---
> üîß React Native doesn't have native `EventSource` implementation, so in order to use the realtime service you'll need to load a `EventSource` polyfill.
> I recommend [EventSource/eventsource](https://github.com/EventSource/eventsource)
> ```sh
> # Using npm
> npm install eventsource --save
>
> # Using yarn
> yarn add eventsource
> ```
> ```js 
> // EventSource.ts
> var Source = require('event-source');
> global.EventSource = Source;
> ```

## Usage

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { Pocketbase } from 'pocketbase-react';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const storage = AsyncStorage
const serverURL = "YOUR_SERVER_URL"
const collections = ['COLLECTION_NAME_01', 'COLLECTION_NAME_02']
const credentials = {
    username: 'YOUR_EMAIL',
    password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
}

<Pocketbase
    storage={storage}
    serverURL={serverURL}
    initialCollections={collections}
    credentials={credentials}>
    <APP />
</Pocketbase>
```

## Caveats
```tsx
import { useAppContent } = "pocketbase-reactjs";
```
### Records
Reading the records value directly accesses the Redux Store.

The value will be changed automatically by the following actions:
- [Initial Fetch](#)
- [Initial Collections](#usage)
- [Subscribe](#subscribe)
- [Refetch](#refetch)

**Without** Initial Fetch
```tsx
// Corresponds to the stored Redux value, simply reads without making further PocketBase requests
const { records } = useAppContent("COLLECTION_NAME_01")
```
**With** Initial Fetch
```tsx
// When initializing, the desired table is queried once and updated in Redux, records corresponds to the stored Redux value
const { records } = useAppContent("COLLECTION_NAME_01", true)
```

### Actions
```tsx
const { actions } = useAppContent("COLLECTION_NAME_01")
```

> *All following actions are performed on the desired table, in this case -> COLLECTION_NAME_01*
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **All actions will not return anything, they will just modify the Redux value according to their intention** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Subscribe
```tsx
actions.subscribe();
```
Unsubscribe
```tsx
actions.unsubscribe();
```
Refetch
```tsx
actions.refetch();
```
Create
```tsx
const object = {};
actions.create(object);
```
Update
```tsx
const id = "SOME_ID";
const object = {};
actions.update(id, object);
```
DELETE
```tsx
const id = "SOME_ID";
actions.delete(id);
```
